# Python Telegram Bot Scanner for Crypto Based on Buy and Sell Signals of Selectable Technical Indicators with Adjustable Boundaries

This Python Telegram bot scanner is designed to generate buy and sell signals for cryptocurrencies based on technical indicators. The scanner is built using Python and uses Telegram as the primary interface. It can be used to backtest trading strategies and generate real-time trading signals.

## Selectable Technical Indicators with Adjustable Boundaries

The scanner allows users to select from a variety of technical indicators to generate buy and sell signals. Some of the indicators that can be selected include:

- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Stochastic RSI
- Stochastic
- Bollinger Bands
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Users can also adjust the boundaries of the indicators to customize the signals generated by the scanner.

## Usage

To use the scanner, you will need to install all the required external modules listed in the requirements.txt file. Once you have installed the modules, you can enable or disable the technical indicators from the Telegram interface by sending a command to the bot. The bot will respond with buy/sell signals based on the technical indicators selected by the user.

## Backtesting

The scanner can be used to backtest trading strategies using historical market data. To backtest a strategy, you will need to calculate the strategy's technical indicators by calling the `populate_indicators()` method for every pair. You can then calculate buy/sell signals by calling the `populate_sell_trend()` method.

## Real-Time Trading Signals

The scanner can also be used to generate real-time trading signals. To do this, you will need to monitor the pitch between the current EMA-25 value and the previous EMA-25 value. If the pitch exceeds a certain value, it signals rising prices, and the scanner will place a buy order. If the pitch falls below a certain value, the scanner will place a sell order.

## Telegram Bot

To use the scanner as a Telegram bot, you will need to create a bot using the Telegram Bot API and obtain a bot token. Once you have the token, you can run the `telegram_bot.py` file to start the bot. The bot will listen for commands and respond with buy/sell signals based on the technical indicators selected by the user.
